Handler Relational Spring Sample. It contains things that I have experienced as Java Developer at Company. Of course, it can't be the best solution for anyone. If you have better ideas, let's share with us in order to expands knowledge to our **Comunity**.

This repository contains:

###### 1. The Simplest Sample for Relational Entity in Spring JPA, Hibernate.
###### 2. Mapstruct: let's use it instead of ModelMapper, trust me, it's interesting.
###### 3. CustomRestTemplate.
###### 4. Specification JPA(feature/specification).
``` 
With Specification JPA you can optimize the number of APIs.
Instead of using multiple APIs using to filter only one entity, 
using Specification you can filter some simple operation with just one API. 
I have made some custom to make it easier to use.

- Use this /api/user/filter?username.equal=Duy_1&name.like=Le Van
- You can get your expected result. It can help FE developer filter as if they write a SQL Query right :D.
